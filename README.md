# STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING

This repository holds a collection of programs developed while undertaking Structured Programming as a course unit of my computer science degree at the Islamic University In Uganda. The programming language used to teach this course unit is python and consequently, all the source code files have been written in python.

## Structure of the Repo

Every concept is attributed a folder which contains source code files for the tasks accomplished during the learning of that concept For example the _learning-output_ contains source code files related to learning how to output / print

I hope you find something useful.
